Introduction To Spring

Spring is one of the best frameworks available for java.

Yes we have different framework before Example for



Web Development we use Sturts.
In the enterprise market, we use happy with EJP.
For the database side, we use JPA.

The one thing that is amazing about the spring that it can focus on POJOS.(Plain Old Java Object)
Spring is actually the combination of multiple projects.

Example: If you want to achieve a very common feature of the spring which is Dependency Injection.

          We have a separate module for it and if one wants to build Web application we have separate module or it

          And if one wants to build the rest application we have separate module. The Spring Framework can also be used for security.
