# Spring-Java-Framwork

Introduction To Spring

Spring is one of the best frameworks available for java.

Yes we have different framework before Example for



Web Development we use Sturts.
In the enterprise market, we use happy with EJP.
For the database side, we use JPA.

But now with the spring, you can achieve everything.
The one thing that is amazing about the spring that it can focus on POJOS.(Plain Old Java Object)
Spring is actually the combination of multiple projects.

Example: If you want to achieve a very common feature of the spring which is Dependency Injection.

          We have a separate module for it and if one wants to build Web application we have separate module or it

          And if one wants to build the rest application we have separate module. The Spring Framework can also be used for security.

          **The Spring is basically the collection of the module it has**
          
          
          **The official documentation of the spring is found on the Spring.io**

The spring is designed and maintained by the Pivatol.

The spring is actually open source project.
Now,
   If click on spring project we have lot of projects    (https://spring.io/projects)
   
   
   
                                                 ***Prqusites For Spring***
   
   
-One should know java- Core java Part is very Important, you should know what is oops, what is exception handling, what is threads, loops

-The database connectivity (MySQL with java, Postgres with java, JDBC Connection is IMP)

-Servlets and JSP, In the java framework we usually work on TOMCAT, Tomcat is a servlet container which means even if you are running the spring framework on Tomcat ultimately everything is converted into the servlet. So good knowledge of servlet and JSP is important.

-The basics concepts should be strong - Ex-

-One should know how to send data from client to server, what is HTTP request object, HTTP response object, etc

-One should know ORM Framework it can be Hibernate/iBATIS/JPA

-One should know how the internet works, how the protocol works

-For spring security one should know -LDAP and OAuth.
